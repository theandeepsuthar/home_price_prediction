# home_price_prediction

The Home Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based project that predicts the prices of residential properties. By leveraging historical property data and utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project provides users with estimated prices for houses based on their features and location. The project also includes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Flask, CSS, and HTML.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The project preprocesses and cleans the historical property data, transforming it into a suitable format for machine learning model training.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other property attributes are incorporated to enhance the prediction model's accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, are employed to predict home prices based on the input features.
Graphical User Interface: The Flask framework is used to develop a user-friendly GUI where users can input property details and obtain estimated prices for houses.
CSS and HTML Styling: CSS and HTML are utilized to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the GUI, providing an intuitive user experience.
